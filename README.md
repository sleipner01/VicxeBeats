# VicxeBeats
An old project to make a website for a friend who wanted to sell beats online. Obviously too big of a project for me at the time, but I learned a lot!
Made an admin-panel (based of [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/) Material Dashboard Dark Design). Made a log-in system in PHP. Not the best code in the world, but it works! 


### Setup

* Set up a localhost environment with apache and some form of SQL database system.
* Create a database named "martinsbeats"
* Run the script in the SQL-stmt file to create tables and test values
* Run a local Apache server
* Open index.php with localhost in the browser

* To make a user admin, you have to manually add "1" to the userID in the "admins"-table
